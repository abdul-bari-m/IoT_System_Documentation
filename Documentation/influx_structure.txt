InfluxDB Time-Series Data Structure
----------------------------------

Purpose:
InfluxDB is used to store historical sensor data generated by IoT devices.
It is optimized for time-series workloads and high write throughput.

Bucket:
- Name: iot_data
- Retention Policy: 7 days (raw sensor data)

Measurement:
- temperature
- humidity (optional, future extension)

Tags (Indexed Metadata):
- device_id (e.g., dev101, dev102)
- location (optional)
- sensor_type

Fields (Actual Sensor Values):
- value (float)

Timestamp:
- Automatically generated by InfluxDB
- Stored in nanoseconds precision

Example Data Point:
temperature,device_id=dev101 value=27.5

Usage Pattern:
- All incoming sensor readings are written to InfluxDB
- Used for historical analysis, graphs, and trends
- Queried by Flask API for dashboard history views

Query Examples (Conceptual):
- Last 10 readings for a device
- Average temperature over last 1 hour
- Device-wise aggregation

Reason for Using InfluxDB:
- Efficient time-based queries
- Handles high-frequency sensor data
- Built-in retention and downsampling support
