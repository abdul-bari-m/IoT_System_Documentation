Redis Real-Time Data Structure
----------------------------

Purpose:
Redis is used to handle real-time sensor data where fast access is important.
It stores only the most recent sensor readings so the dashboard can load quickly.

Data Stored:
- Latest sensor value for each device
- Temporary data meant for short-term use

Key Design:
- Format: device:<device_id>:latest_temperature
- Example: device:dev101:latest_temperature

Value:
- Current temperature value (for example, 27.5)

Expiration (TTL):
- Each key has a short expiry time, such as 60 seconds
- This prevents outdated values from staying in memory

Example Entry:
Key: device:dev101:latest_temperature
Value: 27.5
TTL: 60 seconds

Usage Pattern:
- When new sensor data arrives, Redis is updated first
- The web dashboard requests the latest value from Redis
- If the value is not available, the system reads from InfluxDB

Why Redis:
- Very fast read and write operations
- Reduces unnecessary queries to the database
- Well suited for live monitoring dashboards

Role in the System:
Redis is responsible for real-time data access,
while InfluxDB is used for storing historical sensor data.
